                    <p>
                        <b>
                            The badly thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software was the reason
                            nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England.
                        </b>

                    </p> 
                     <p>
                        And it appears that Public Health England (PHE) was to blame, rather than a
                        third-party contractor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The issue was caused by the way the agencyught together logs produced 
                        by commercial firms paid to analyse swab tests of the public, to discover who 
                        has the virus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They filed their results in the form of text-based lists -
                        known as CSV files - without issue.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel
                        templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made
                        available to the NHS Test and Trace team, as well as other government 
                        computer dashboards.
                    </p> 
                 <img src="images/24c89e05-5a30-4a17-a2b6-c53b49ab5be1.jpg" >
                    <p>
                        The problem is that PHE's own developers picked an old file format to do this -
                        known as XLS.
                    </p> 
                    <P>
                        As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data
                        rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant
                        that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases
                    </p>
                     
                    <p>
                        When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        For a bit of context, Excel's XLS file format dates back to 1987. It was
                        superseded by XLSX in 2007. Had this been used, it would have handled 16
                        times the number of cases.
                    </p> 
                     
                    <p>
                        At the very least, that would have prevented the error from happening until 
                        testing levels were significantly higher than they are today,
                    </p>
                     
                    <p>
                        But one expert suggested that even a high-school computing student would
                        know that better alternatives exist.
                    </p>
                     
                    <p>
                        "Excel was always meant for people mucking around with a bunch of data for
                        their small company to see what it looked like," commented Prof Jon
                        Crowcroft from the University of Cadge.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        "And then when you need to do something more serious, you build something
                        bespoke that works - there's dozens of other things you could do.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But you wouldn't use XLS. Nobody would start with that."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Speaking in the House of Commons, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock
                        suggested that the problem had emerged as a result of PHE using a "legacy
                       system" and a decision had been taken two months ago to replace it.
                    </p>
                 <img src="images/_114774594_hanocklc.jpg" >
                    <p>
                        Presumably, however, this specific problem had not been spotted. Otherwise
                        PHE would have realised that the flaw would come into effect before
                        the upgrade was complete.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Mr Hancock was challenged to put other relevant data-process diagrams into
                        the public domain, so other hidden failings in the government's digital
                        apparatus could be found.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        But while the minister said he would see what was possible, he added: "The
                        challenge of a maximum file size error is that it wouldn't necessarily appear on
                        those sorts of flowcharts."
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        PHE is confident that test results were not missed until last week, because of
                        the flaw.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        And in its defence, the agency would note that it caught most of the cases
                        within a day or two of the records slipping through its net.
                    </p>
                 <img src="images/_114774597_covid.jpg">
                    <p>
                        But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said lives had still
                        been put at risk because the contact-tracing process had been delayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Thousands of people [were] blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid,
                        potentially spreading this deadly virus at a time when hospital admissions are
                        increasing," he told the House of Commons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This isn't just a shambles. It's so much worse."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To handle the problem, PHE is nowaking down the test result data into
                        smaller batches to create a larger number of Excel templates. That should
                        ensure none hit their cap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But insiders acknowledge that the current clunky system needs to be replaced
                     by something more advanced that excludes Excel, as soon as possible.
