            <p> <b>The badly thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software was the reason 
                <br> nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England.</b>
                 <br>
                 <br> And it appears that Public Health England (PHE) was to blame, rather than a 
                 <br> third-party contractor.
                 <br>
                 <br>The issue was caused by the way the agency brought together logs produced 
                 <br>by commercial firms paid to analyse swab tests of the public, to discover who 
                 <br> has the virus.
                 <br>
                 <br> They filed their results in the form of text-based lists -
                 <br> known as CSV files - without issue.
                 <br>
                 <br> PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel
                 <br> templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made
                 <br> available to the NHS Test and Trace team, as well as other government 
                 <br>computer dashboards.
                 <br>
                </p>
            <img src="images/24c89e05-5a30-4a17-a2b6-c53b49ab5be1.jpg" with="400px" height="400px">
            <p>
                <br> The problem is that PHE's own developers picked an old file format to do this -
                <br>  known as XLS.
                <br> As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data
                <br> rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of.
                <br> 
                <br> And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant
                <br> that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases.
                <br> 
                <br> When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off.
                <br> For a bit of context, Excel's XLS file format dates back to 1987. It was
                <br> superseded by XLSX in 2007. Had this been used, it would have handled 16
                <br> times the number of cases.
                <br> 
                <br> At the very least, that would have prevented the error from happening until 
                <br> testing levels were significantly higher than they are today,
                <br> 
                <br> But one expert suggested that even a high-school computing student would
                <br> know that better alternatives exist.
                <br> 
                <br> "Excel was always meant for people mucking around with a bunch of data for
                <br> their small company to see what it looked like," commented Prof Jon
                <br> Crowcroft from the University of Cambridge.
                <br>
                <br> "And then when you need to do something more serious, you build something
                <br> bespoke that works - there's dozens of other things you could do.
                <br>
                <br> "But you wouldn't use XLS. Nobody would start with that."
                <br>
                <br> Speaking in the House of Commons, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock
                <br> suggested that the problem had emerged as a result of PHE using a "legacy
                <br>system" and a decision had been taken two months ago to replace it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> Presumably, however, this specific problem had not been spotted. Otherwise
                <br> PHE would have realised that the flaw would come into effect before
                <br> the upgrade was complete.
                <br>
                <br> Mr Hancock was challenged to put other relevant data-process diagrams into
                <br> the public domain, so other hidden failings in the government's digital
                <br> apparatus could be found.
                <br>
                <br> But while the minister said he would see what was possible, he added: "The
                <br> challenge of a maximum file size error is that it wouldn't necessarily appear on
                <br>  those sorts of flowcharts."
                <br>
                <br> PHE is confident that test results were not missed until last week, because of
                <br>  the flaw.
                <br>
                <br> And in its defence, the agency would note that it caught most of the cases
                <br> within a day or two of the records slipping through its net.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <br> But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said lives had still
                <br> been put at risk because the contact-tracing process had been delayed.
                <br>
                <br> "Thousands of people [were] blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid,
                <br> potentially spreading this deadly virus at a time when hospital admissions are
                <br> increasing," he told the House of Commons.
                <br>
                <br> This isn't just a shambles. It's so much worse."
                <br>
                <br> To handle the problem, PHE is now breaking down the test result data into
                <br> smaller batches to create a larger number of Excel templates. That should
                <br> ensure none hit their cap.
                <br>
                <br> But insiders acknowledge that the current clunky system needs to be replaced
                <br> by something more advanced that excludes Excel, as soon as possible.
                <br>
