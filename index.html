                <p>
                    <b>
                        The badly thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software was the reason<br> 
                        nearly 16,000 coronavirus cases went unreported in England.<br>
                    </b>
                </p> 
                 <p>
                    And it appears that Public Health England (PHE) was to blame, rather than a <br>
                    third-party contractor.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issue was caused by the way the agencyught together logs produced <br>
                    by commercial firms paid to analyse swab tests of the public, to discover who <br>
                    has the virus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They filed their results in the form of text-based lists -<br>
                    known as CSV files - without issue.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    PHE had set up an automatic process to pull this data together into Excel<br>
                    templates so that it could then be uploaded to a central system and made<br>
                    available to the NHS Test and Trace team, as well as other government <br>
                    computer dashboards.
                </p> 
            </p>
            <img src="images/24c89e05-5a30-4a17-a2b6-c53b49ab5be1.jpg" with="400px" height="400px">
            <p>
                <p>
                    The problem is that PHE's own developers picked an old file format to do this -<br>
                    known as XLS.
                </p> 
                <P>
                    As a consequence, each template could handle only about 65,000 rows of data<br>
                    rather than the one million-plus rows that Excel is actually capable of.
                </P>
                <p>
                    And since each test result created several rows of data, in practice it meant<br>
                    that each template was limited to about 1,400 cases
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                    When that total was reached, further cases were simply left off.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    For a bit of context, Excel's XLS file format dates back to 1987. It was<br>
                    superseded by XLSX in 2007. Had this been used, it would have handled 16<br>
                    times the number of cases.
                </p> 
                 
                <p>
                    At the very least, that would have prevented the error from happening until<br> 
                    testing levels were significantly higher than they are today,
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                    But one expert suggested that even a high-school computing student would<br>
                    know that better alternatives exist.
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                    "Excel was always meant for people mucking around with a bunch of data for<br>
                    their small company to see what it looked like," commented Prof Jon<br>
                    Crowcroft from the University of Cadge.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "And then when you need to do something more serious, you build something<br>
                    bespoke that works - there's dozens of other things you could do.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But you wouldn't use XLS. Nobody would start with that."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Speaking in the House of Commons, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock<br>
                    suggested that the problem had emerged as a result of PHE using a "legacy<br>
                   system" and a decision had been taken two months ago to replace it.
                </p>
                
            </p>
            <img src="images/_114774594_hanocklc.jpg" with="400px" height="400px">
            <p>
                <p>
                    Presumably, however, this specific problem had not been spotted. Otherwise<br>
                    PHE would have realised that the flaw would come into effect before<br>
                    the upgrade was complete.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mr Hancock was challenged to put other relevant data-process diagrams into<br>
                    the public domain, so other hidden failings in the government's digital<br>
                    apparatus could be found.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But while the minister said he would see what was possible, he added: "The<br>
                    challenge of a maximum file size error is that it wouldn't necessarily appear on<br>
                    those sorts of flowcharts."
                </p>

                <p>
                    PHE is confident that test results were not missed until last week, because of<br>
                    the flaw.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    And in its defence, the agency would note that it caught most of the cases<br>
                    within a day or two of the records slipping through its net.
                </p>
                
            </p>
            <img src="images/_114774597_covid.jpg" with="400px" height="400px">
            <p>
                <p>
                    But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said lives had still<br>
                    been put at risk because the contact-tracing process had been delayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Thousands of people [were] blissfully unaware they've been exposed to Covid,<br>
                    potentially spreading this deadly virus at a time when hospital admissions are<br>
                    increasing," he told the House of Commons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't just a shambles. It's so much worse."
                </p>
                <p>
                    To handle the problem, PHE is nowaking down the test result data into<br>
                    smaller batches to create a larger number of Excel templates. That should<br>
                    ensure none hit their cap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But insiders acknowledge that the current clunky system needs to be replaced<br>
                 by something more advanced that excludes Excel, as soon as possible.
                </p>
